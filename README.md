## Sprint Planning 11.21

Sprint Planning: You have a forecast of how many story points your team can complete during the sprint. The forecast is documented in your README.

##### For our Sprint Goal, we estimate that we will be able to complete 50 points.

The rationale for your forecast is documented in your README

##### Last Sprint, we estimated 75 story points but were only able to complete about a little over half. Since our time-constraints are similar for this next we are estimating 50 points this Sprint.

##### Our goal is to expand on our existing MVP. Last Sprint, we built an application that only contains a home page (the team decided the Home Page was the most essential part of the app because it allows the site to be found via search engines). In this coming sprint, we plan to create a login functionality, as well as a QR Code.

You pulled stories into your sprint backlog.

##### Our Sprint Backlog can be found at [https://xtremeteam3.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&amp;projectKey=SFDA&amp;selectedIssue=SFDA-12](https://xtremeteam3.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&amp;projectKey=SFDA&amp;selectedIssue=SFDA-12) and includes three product backlog items totaling 47 Story points.

You pulled stories from the top of your product backlog.

##### Our Sprint Backlog includes the next three items on our Product Backlog.

The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed your forecast.

##### Our forecast was 50, and the Aggregate Size of our stories are 47.

Development Team members participated in this activity (and in your project README, you made a statement or provided evidence that only Development Team members participated in this activity). (1 point for each item)

##### Only our Development team participated in the Sprint Planning Session.

All of the stories in your sprint backlog are the right size: the size of each backlog item is less than half your forecast velocity for the sprint. If you noticed PBIs that are too large to get done in a sprint, you refined them by splitting them into smaller stories and estimating the smaller stories.

##### We took some time to consider Backlog. Our PBI&#39;s were not too large, however we decided to refine our Product Backlog by creating a new PBI. We then modified the order of the backlog but did not need to change any of the existing PBIs.

##### We have three user stories in our Sprint backlog. They are:

##### Create QR Code : ESTIMATION 21

##### Story: As a Family, I need to get QR Code online to be identified for Humanitarian Relief

##### Acceptance Criteria: A page is created on the site that displays a unique QR Code every time is is loaded. A database is created to store each QR code and confirm unique ones are being generated

##### Build Login Page : ESTIMATION 13

##### Story: As an app user, I need a page to login

##### Acceptance Criteria: A page must be created that allow the user to login. Login should not occur if username and password are not in database.

##### Remove Unnecessary Elements From Product Increment: ESTIMATION 13

##### User Story: As an app user (donor, family, NPO), I want the application to only contain working elements. Any unworking elements will diminish my confidence in the application.

##### Acceptance Criteria: Home page should not contain and broken links and the Sign Up Page&#39;s validation should work or not be present.

You decomposed user stories into developer tasks (1 point). The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog (1 point).

##### We decomposed our user stories into developer tasks. These can be found on our Kanban board at [https://xtremeteam3.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&amp;projectKey=SFDA&amp;selectedIssue=SFDA-129](https://xtremeteam3.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&amp;projectKey=SFDA&amp;selectedIssue=SFDA-129) .

Your sprint backlog, including both the user stories and developer tasks, is represented in a kanban board (1 point). The URL of the kanban board is documented in your README (1 point). Course staff can view the kanban board (1 point).

##### Our Kanban Board can be found on our JIRA page @[https://xtremeteam3.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&amp;projectKey=SFDA&amp;selectedIssue=SFDA-12](https://xtremeteam3.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&amp;projectKey=SFDA&amp;selectedIssue=SFDA-12)

You have a sprint burndown chart. On the x-axis, you display time markers in units of 1 day. On the y-axis, you display story points remaining to get done. There is a linear curve descending from left to right; the leftmost point of the curve is number of story points in your sprint at sprint day 1; the rightmost point is 0 story points remaining on the last day of the sprint. The burndown chart, or the URL of the burndown chart, is document in your README. Course staff can view the burndown chart. (1 point for each sentence you complete)

##### For our Sprint Burndown Chart we decided to use an excel spreadsheet. To do this, we adapted it from a template that we found a website called coria.com (Full URL: https://www.coria.com/insights/blog/project-management/how-to-create-a-burndown-chart-in-excel)

Daily Scrum: You have conducted multiple Daily Scrums. You document evidence of at least one daily scrum in your README your daily scrums, you discussed: what did you do in the last 24 hours that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? In your README, document which team members did which activities. (1 point for each team member&#39;s response, up to a maximum of 5 points)

In your daily scrums, you discussed: what will you do in the next 24 hours to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? In your README, document which team members plan to do which activities. (1 point for each team member&#39;s response, up to a maximum of 5 points

In your daily scrums, you discussed: do you see any impediment that prevents you or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments? What is your impediment removal plan? (1 point for each question answered)

##### Notes from three daily scrums can be found at the bottom of the README. We discussed our impediments, what we did in the last 24 Hours and what we planned to do in the next 24 hours.

Every day during the sprint, update your sprint task board and burndown chart. Provide evidence (URLs or images) in your README to show that you did this. (1 point for each time you updated your tracking indicators, up to a maximum of 2 points)

##### When we met, we updated our task list and burndown chart. We have included four pictures: Before and After of our Kanban Board and Before and after of our Burndown Chart.

Pair- or Mob-Programming: There is evidence that you paired or mobbed on your code. The evidence could be a photo or video of your team working together, or it could be some other kind of evidence. The evidence is included in your README. (1 point for each team member who participated, up to a maximum of 5 points)

##### We completed our first task together during a mob programming session. For evidence, we have included pictures of our zoom session.

Test-Driven Development: There is evidence that you are building your product test-first. There are at least 20 micro-scale unit tests in your test suite, and they all pass. (1 point for each \*new\* unit test that you created in this sprint, up to a maximum of 10 points)

##### Our application contains over 20 tests. The last sprint we lost points because the tests were written after the code and did not cover all of the functionality. This Sprint, we did things differently by writing our tests before coding and creating micro tests to explore individual functionalities like form validation. Our tests are in three separate files and can be found at:

##### [https://github.com/jcvalladares/xtreamteam/blob/main/sfda/src/test/java/com/sfda/users/UsersApplicationTests.java](https://github.com/jcvalladares/xtreamteam/blob/main/sfda/src/test/java/com/sfda/users/UsersApplicationTests.java)

##### [https://github.com/jcvalladares/xtreamteam/blob/main/sfda/src/test/java/com/sfda/users/SFDAUserValidatorTest.java](https://github.com/jcvalladares/xtreamteam/blob/main/sfda/src/test/java/com/sfda/users/SFDAUserValidatorTest.java)

##### [https://github.com/jcvalladares/xtreamteam/blob/main/sfda/src/test/java/com/sfda/util/QRCodeGeneratorTest.java](https://github.com/jcvalladares/xtreamteam/blob/main/sfda/src/test/java/com/sfda/util/QRCodeGeneratorTest.java)

Sprint Review: Your team conducts a Sprint Review.

##### Our Sprint Review was conducted at the end of our Sprint on NOV 30. We all felt positive about the changes we implemented and felt that we were able to increase our productivity.

Your product increment is working software. The working software is running on a publicly accessible system (this could be a web server, a mobile app store, or something else.) Your README includes evidence that your product increment is working software. Your README includes the URL of the working software, an invitation to test the mobile app, etc. (1 point for each sentence in this rubric element)

##### Our Product increment is working software. Evidence for this can be seen by accessing the application&#39;s URL at : [http://54.219.4.96:8080](http://54.219.4.96:8080/)

At least one stakeholder attends your sprint review, and you provide evidence that your stakeholder was there. You revise your product backlog based on the feedback you receive. (1 point for each sentence in this rubric item)

##### During our Sprint Review, a stakeholder,Maybel Salgado, attended. She represents the families in need. She is a graphic designer and commented on the look and feel of the site. She gave all positive feedback so we will continue with our current graphic layout plan moving forward. We did not need to revise our Product Backlog, but will keep her feedback in mind if we need to create any future products backlog items. Pictures are below.

Continuous Integration: You have a Continuous Integration system running. You only work on the main/trunk/master together—there are no long-lived code branches. The CI system automatically builds your code every time you push to main/trunk/master. The CI system automatically executes all your tests every time it builds the code. You have provided evidence that your CI system exists and behaves properly. (1 point for each sentence in this rubric element

##### We built our CI Pipeline with Jenkins. It is running on a Docker container on our server. It automatically builds every time we push our code to the repo. After building, it automatically executes our tests.

##### To automatically build and test our code, our GitHub server uses a webhook to push events to our Jenkins instance. If an event is sent, it runs the Jenkinsfile in the server. Our Jenkins file can be found at [https://github.com/jcvalladares/xtreamteam/blob/main/Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/jcvalladares/xtreamteam/blob/main/Jenkinsfile) and runs the tests with the following command:

##### sh "${env.M2\_HOME}/bin/mvn -f ${env.WORKSPACE}/sfda/pom.xml clean install&quot;"

##### Evidence for our working pipeline can also be found on our Jenkins Instance (credentials below)

##### URL: [http://54.219.4.96:8081/](http://54.219.4.96:8081/)

##### Login: with team3

##### Password: Xtreme123!

##### Also, latest pipeline's console output demonstrates that the pipeline builds the application and runs the tests. This can be found at the link below (test confirmation is toward the bottom of the output).

##### [http://54.219.4.96:8081/job/sfp-build-pipeline/14/console](http://54.219.4.96:8081/job/sfp-build-pipeline/14/console)

Continuous Delivery: You have a Continuous Delivery system running. When the build is &quot;green&quot;, the CD system deploys your software to a production environment (&quot;Production&quot;); when the build is &quot;red&quot;, the CD system doesn&#39;t alter Production. The CD system executes additional tests of your software in Production to ensure Production is up and running successfully after deployment. You have provided evidence that your CD system exists and behaves properly

##### Our CD Pipeline also executes in Jenkins. Our pipeline contains a parameter that allows the user to determine if it wants to deploy the application to production. If the box is selected, the &#39;Deploy&#39; section of the Jenkins script is run and the application is &quot;deployed to production&quot;. In addition, we add an additional environment test (via a curl command) to confirm everything was deployed properly.

##### Our pipeline can be found on the Jenkins Instance:

##### URL: [http://54.219.4.96:8081/](http://54.219.4.96:8081/)

##### Login: with team3

##### Password: Xtreme123!

##### Our production environment is not yet online, so imitate a production deployment we are re-running the .jar file.

##### Additionally, we have the CD pipeline fully functioning locally. More details can be found at:

Sprint Retrospective: Your team conducts a Sprint Retrospective. All team members participate in the sprint retrospective. As a team, you identify at least one helpful change to improve your effectiveness together. You make a concrete plan for making that change during the next sprint. (Provide evidence. 1 point for each sentence in this rubric element.)

##### At the end of our sprint, on NOV 29th, we conducted our Sprint Retrospective. All team members were present.

##### ISSUE: We did a great job of updating our tasks, but could have done better.

##### SOLUTION: Instead of waiting until the group meets to update tasks, we will update the tasks as soon as we complete them, and then will review with the group afterwards.

##### ISSUE: We felt that our diverse CI/CD knowledge prevented us from coordinating and being as effective as possible.

##### SOLUTION: Moving forward, the developers without Jenkins experience will spend some time researching.

##### ISSUE: We felt our version control knowledge differed enough to prevent us from being as effective as possible.

##### SOLUTION; Moving forward, the developers without version control experience will spend time researching it.


## DAILY_SCRUM 1 11.21

Impediments

WEB SERVER ISSUE: One impediment is that our web server has a bug that is causing it to shut down.

Impediment Removal Plan: We have identified our Angular Server as the cause of the issue. To remove the impediment, we will change our server configuration to serve a static webpage.

WEB SERVER ISSUE: Another impediment we identified was that our skill sets do not overlap.
